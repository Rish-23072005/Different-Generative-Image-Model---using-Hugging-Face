1. Approach
Select Models: Use popular text-to-image models from Hugging Face (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALLÂ·E Mini, Kandinsky, etc.).
Input Prompt: Use the same text prompt for all models.
Generate Images: Run inference for each model.
Display Results: Show images side-by-side for visual comparison.
(Optional) Analysis: Briefly discuss differences in output.

3. How to Use
Open Google Colab.
Copy-paste the code above into a new notebook.
Run all cells.
Change the prompt variable to test different prompts.

4. Comparative Analysis of used model
Stable Diffusion 1.5: Fast, good for general prompts, sometimes less detailed.
Stable Diffusion XL: More detailed, better at complex scenes, larger model.
Kandinsky 2.2: Unique style, sometimes more abstract or artistic.
